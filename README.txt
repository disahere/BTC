1. The ball supposedly moves along the corridor, but in fact it is the floor and ceiling moving on the screen.
2. There are holes in the floor and ceiling. Pressing the screen changes the gravity and the ball jumps from the floor to the ceiling. Pressing again returns it down.
3. The player's task is to prevent the ball from falling into the hole.
4. The minimal game interface is needed: pause, start, score count, etc.
5. It should be developed in Unity, it can be 3D or pseudo-2D. The size of the holes and platforms should be random.
The most important thing is that the game is playable, functional, and stable. No physics or real gravity is required, only a working prototype is needed.
